        <h1>Life with the Prince</h1>
        <h3 class="highlight">At the Palace</h3>

        <p>When she awakens on the shore, the prince finds her. 
           <span class="accent">He takes her to his palace</span>, mesmerized by her beauty. 
           She <span class="highlight">dances gracefully despite her pain</span>, but he sees her only as a 
           <span class="accent">dear friend</span>â€”not as the girl who saved him.
        </p>

        <p>Her silent suffering deepens as he speaks of the girl from the temple, 
           whom he believes he is destined to love.
        </p>
