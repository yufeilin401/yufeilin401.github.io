    <h1><b><i>Life with the Prince</i></b></h1>
    <h3>At the Palace</h3>
    <p>When she awakens on the shore, the prince finds her. <b><i>He takes her to his palace</i></b>, mesmerized by her beauty. She <b><i>dances gracefully despite her pain</i></b>, but he sees her only as a <i><b>dear friend</b></i>â€”not as the girl who saved him.
        <br>
        <br>
        Her silent suffering deepens as he speaks of the girl from the temple, whom he believes he is destined to love.
