    <h1><b><i>Ending 2 - Dissolving into Sea Foam</i></b></h1>
    <p>The blade sinks beneath the waves. She follows it, letting the water embrace her. As the sun rises, she feels her body dissolveâ€”light as mist, fading into the sea. The prince sleeps. The world moves on. She is nothing now. <b><i>Only foam upon the waves.</i></b></p>
