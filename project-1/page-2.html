        <p class="intro-text">Far beneath the sea, where the water is as clear as crystal, the young mermaid lives with her father, the Mer-King, and her five older sisters. Unlike them, she is quiet and thoughtful, longing not just for the human world but for something even greater—
            <br>
            <span class="highlight">an immortal soul.</span></p>

        <p>Each year, when her sisters turn fifteen, they rise to the surface to witness the world above. When her turn finally comes, she sees a <span class="highlight">grand ship</span> where a handsome <span class="highlight">prince</span> is celebrating his birthday. A sudden <span class="accent">storm destroys the ship</span>, and she rescues the unconscious prince, carrying him to shore. But before he awakens, a girl from a nearby <span class="highlight">temple</span> finds him—he believes <span class="accent">she</span> was the one who saved him.</p>

        <p class="sad-ending"><span class="accent">Heartbroken</span>, the mermaid watches from the waves before returning to the sea.</p>
