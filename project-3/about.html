        <em>Starlight Inquiries</em> is a digital crystal ball that lets you ask anything—from deep life questions to delightfully dumb thoughts—and receive glowing, mysterious replies from the stars. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it's a playful reimagining of the classic <a href="https://magic-8ball.com/magic-8-ball-answers/" target="_blank" style="color:#F1F1BA; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline dotted;">Magic 8 Ball</a>, blending ancient rituals with pixel art and code.

        This project was born out of curiosity: what happens when you take something traditionally spiritual and let a computer answer instead? Can a website feel magical? From the flickering header and floating sparkles to the spinning crystal ball animation, every detail was designed to feel soft, mystical, and slightly absurd—in the best way.

        Sometimes sincere, sometimes silly, <em>Starlight Inquiries</em> is here to listen. Your secrets are safe with JavaScript. ✨
